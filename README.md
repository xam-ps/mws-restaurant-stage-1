# Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course


## Getting started
The project was set up with Grunt. Today I would use webpack, but as eveything is working perfectly fine (however a little slow) I decided to not redo the pipeline.

You can start the dev server via `grunt start`.

A version for distribution can be generated with `grunt dist`, which will create a 'dist' folder with all necessary files.
